We present Matlab code to reproduce all analyses and figures from the paper "Host behaviour driven by awareness of infection risk amplifies the chance of superspreading events" by Kris V Parag and Robin N Thompson. Preprint available at: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.25.23294423v1

System Requirements

Should work with Matlab v2022 and above. Tested on macOS v13.4.1.
Slight dependence on the linespecer and boundedline packages (licenses included in main folder).

Instructions and installation

Should work with any standard Matlab installation and generate figures/results.
Run FigX.m where X is the figure in the manuscript to be reproduced.
Code is self contained so no external installations required.
Run times of all scripts are of the order of minutes or faster.
